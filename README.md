#Deduplicater :smiley: :smiley: :arrow_right: :smiley:
A command line application that removes duplicate entries from a JSON file.

##How to use
1. Install Java
1. Clone this repository
1. `$ cd deduplicater/src`
1. `$ javac Main.java -sourcepath ../src -cp ../lib/json-simple-1.1.jar`
1. `$ java -cp "../lib/json-simple-1.1.jar:." Main fileLocation` replacing `fileLocation` with the location of the JSON file you would like to use

##Deduplication Criteria
Two records are considered duplicates if they have the same `id` or `email` (case sensitive).

If two records are duplicates, the record with the later date is preferred. If dates are the same, then the record that appears later in the file is preferred.

##Implementation Details

The program converts the JSON file to an array of `Record` objects (let's call that `records`). The array is sorted by date, and if those are equal then by order in the file.

Two hash tables are constructed.

1. `idToIndexes`: maps the `id` field to a list of indexes in the array that have that id
2. `emailToIndexes`: maps the `email' field to a list of indexes in the array that have that email

The largest record in the array is added to a `uniqueRecords` array and marked as visited. All duplicates of the record are then looked up via the hash tables and marked as visited.

The next largest unvisited record is then added to `uniqueRecords` and it's duplicates are marked as visited. The process continues until we have reached the smallest unvisited record.

##Sample Input
```
{
  "leads": [
    {
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "_id": "1",
      "address": "123 Maple St",
      "email": "john@bar.com",
      "entryDate": "2014-05-07T17:30:20+00:00",
      "firstName": "John"
    },
    {
      "lastName": "Kane",
      "_id": "1",
      "address": "44 Main St",
      "email": "tim@bar.com",
      "entryDate": "2014-05-07T17:30:20+00:00",
      "firstName": "Tim"
    }
  ]
}
```
